# Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Web Applications

Web applications are prone to various types of vulnerabilities. Here we'll be giving a brief intro to some of them. For detailed information, you can refer to https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-materials.

## Tools required
For exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications, we'll be requiring some tools, an important one being Burp Suite, which is a Java based Web Penetration Testing framework. It is a very powerful tool and used for professional purposes as well. You can download it from here (https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload). To get a basic overview of what Burp Suite is, you might like to read https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-burp-suite/ or watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70hvwmwfZeM. 

Also, if you are using Burp Suite for the first time, do watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCCrVtvAu2I to get an idea of how the proxy (which is the main feature of burp that we'll be using extensively) works.

# Types of Vulnerabilities

## Insecure deserialization
### What is serialization and deserialization?
"Serialization is the process of converting complex data structures, such as objects and their fields, into a 'flatter' format that can be sent and received as a sequential stream of bytes." Let's explain this with an example.
Suppose this is our user object,
`$user->name = "carlos";` <br>
`$user->isLoggedIn = true;`

when this data is serialized, it looks like this `O:4:"User":2:{s:4:"name":s:6:"carlos"; s:10:"isLoggedIn":b:1;}`
This can be interpreted as follows:

* O:4:"User" - An object with the 4-character class name "User"
* 2 - the object has 2 attributes
* s:4:"name" - The key of the first attribute is the 4-character string "name"
* s:6:"carlos" - The value of the first attribute is the 6-character string "carlos"
* s:10:"isLoggedIn" - The key of the second attribute is the 10-character string "isLoggedIn"
* b:1 - The value of the second attribute is the boolean value true

Deserialization refers to reversing the serialization on the server side to get back the object that was initially created on the client side.

### Why can it be harmful?

##### Modifying object attributes
Suppose the serialized object is as follows `O:4:"User":2:{s:8:"username":s:6:"carlos"; s:7:"isAdmin":b:0;}`.
If the attacker modifies the `isAdmin` field in the serialized data and change it to `1`, he can gain access to confidential information and priviledges.

To get hands on experience with this task, you can try https://portswigger.net/web-security/deserialization/exploiting/lab-deserialization-modifying-serialized-objects lab on portswigger.

##### Modifying object types
PHP based applications are particularly vulnerable to these kind of vulnerabilities, due to presence of a loose comparison operator `==`.
<br>
What this means is that in PHP if we evaluate the statement `5=="5"`, it evaluates to true and so does `5 == "5 of something"`. However, if there is no number in the string's start, it is evaluated as `0`. So `0=="any string"` would evaluate `true` in PHP.

So what this means is that if the attacker modifies the serialized object to contain password as an integer and set its value to `0`, he can potentially login to any acount in the system!

To get a hands on experience with this task, you can try this lab https://portswigger.net/web-security/deserialization/exploiting/lab-deserialization-modifying-serialized-data-types.
